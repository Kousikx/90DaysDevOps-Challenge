# Day 22 – Introduction to Git

## Overview

Today I officially started learning Git.

Until now, I was writing scripts and running commands,
but today I learned how to track my work properly.

This is where DevOps starts becoming real —
because everything in DevOps revolves around version control.

---

## What I Did Today

### 1. Installed and Configured Git

- Verified Git installation
- Configured my name and email
- Checked configuration using git config --list

This helped me understand that every commit carries identity.

---

### 2. Created My First Git Repository

- Created a folder called devops-git-practice
- Initialized it using git init
- Explored the hidden .git directory
- Used git status to understand repository state

I realized that the .git folder is the heart of the repository.
If it’s deleted, all version history disappears.

---

### 3. Created My Git Commands Reference

I created a file called git-commands.md
and started documenting commands I used today.

This file will continue growing as I learn more Git commands.

Commands added so far:

- git --version
- git config --global
- git init
- git status
- git add
- git commit
- git log
- git log --oneline
- git diff

---

### 4. Practiced Staging and Committing

I:

- Staged files using git add
- Committed changes with meaningful messages
- Viewed history using git log
- Built multiple commits to create clean history

I understood that:

git add → prepares changes  
git commit → records changes  

This separation gives control.

---

## What I Learned

- Git tracks changes over time.
- The staging area allows selective commits.
- A commit is a snapshot of my project at a moment.
- The .git folder stores the entire repository history.
- Clean commit messages matter.

---

## Git Workflow I Practiced

Working Directory  
→ git add  
→ Staging Area  
→ git commit  
→ Repository History  

This simple flow is very powerful.

---

## Challenges I Faced

- Initially confusing difference between add and commit.
- Understanding staging area concept.
- Remembering command syntax.

But after repeating the workflow multiple times,
it started feeling natural.

---

## Key Takeaway

Git is not just about saving code.
It is about managing history and collaboration.

Today I built my first proper repository
and created multiple commits with clear messages.

This feels like the beginning of something important.

Day 22 complete.
