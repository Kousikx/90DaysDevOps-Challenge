# Day 17 – Shell Scripting: Loops, Arguments & Error Handling

## Overview
Today I advanced my shell scripting skills by learning loops, command-line
arguments, package installation automation, and basic error handling.

This day felt closer to real DevOps automation work.

---

## For Loop Scripts
I created scripts to iterate over a list of fruits and to print numbers from 1 to 10.
This helped me understand how loops automate repetitive tasks.

---

## While Loop Script
I wrote a countdown script that takes input from the user and counts down to zero.
This showed how scripts can dynamically respond to user input.

---

## Command-Line Arguments
I created scripts using $1, $#, $@, and $0 to understand how arguments are passed
to scripts and how they can be validated.

---

## Package Installation Script
I automated package installation for nginx, curl, and wget.
The script checks if each package is already installed before installing it.
This prevents unnecessary installations and saves time.

---

## Error Handling
I used set -e and logical operators (||) to handle errors gracefully.
The script stops if a critical command fails and prints messages when issues occur.

---

## What I Learned
1. Loops help automate repetitive tasks efficiently.
2. Command-line arguments make scripts dynamic and reusable.
3. Basic error handling makes scripts safer and more reliable.

---

## Key Takeaway
Shell scripting is a powerful DevOps skill that helps automate system tasks,
reduce manual work, and improve reliability.
