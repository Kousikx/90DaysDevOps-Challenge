## My 90-Day DevOps Learning Plan

## My Current Situation
I come from a **non-technical background**.
I do not have experience in coding, DevOps, or cloud technologies.
I am starting this journey as a **complete beginner**, and I am okay with learning slowly and clearly.

## What I Understand About DevOps and Cloud (In Simple Words)
DevOps means working smarter by:
- Automating daily technical work
- Reducing manual effort and mistakes
- Making software delivery faster and smoother

Cloud means:
- Using online servers instead of physical machines
- Creating and managing systems easily without owning hardware

## Why I Am Starting DevOps & Cloud
I am learning DevOps because:
- I want a **long-term and stable IT career**
- DevOps skills are in high demand worldwide
- I want to move into a technical role even though I am from a non-technical background
- I want to build skills that actually matter in real jobs

## Where I Want to Be After 90 Days
At the end of 90 days, I want to:
1. Be comfortable using **Linux commands**
2. Understand how applications are deployed on **cloud platforms**
3. Have hands-on experience with **Docker and basic CI/CD**

## Core Skills I Want to Build
1. Linux basics and problem-solving
2. Git and simple CI/CD understanding
3. Docker and cloud fundamentals

## Time I Can Honestly Give
- Weekdays: **2 hours daily**
- Weekends: **4–5 hours**
- I will focus on consistency rather than long study hours

## How I Will Stay Consistent
- I will study at a fixed time every day
- I will practice commands instead of only watching videos
- I will revise weekly what I have learned
- I will not quit just because things feel difficult
- I will focus on progress, not perfection

## 90-Day High-Level Plan
- **Days 1–30:** Linux basics, terminal usage, file handling, Git basics
- **Days 31–60:** Docker, CI/CD concepts, cloud fundamentals
- **Days 61–90:** Simple DevOps project, deployment, revision

## My Personal Promise
I promise to show up every day and do my best.
I understand learning DevOps takes time.
Even if progress feels slow, I will continue.
Consistency will take me where motivation cannot.
