# Day 16 – Shell Scripting Basics

## Overview
Today I started my shell scripting journey and learned the basic building blocks
required to automate simple Linux tasks.

I practiced creating scripts, using variables, taking user input, and writing
basic if-else conditions.

---

## Script 1: hello.sh
Printed a simple message using echo.
Learned the importance of the shebang line (#!/bin/bash) to specify the shell.

---

## Script 2: variables.sh
Used variables NAME and ROLE and printed them using echo.
Also understood the difference between single and double quotes.

---

## Script 3: greet.sh
Took user input using read and displayed a personalized message.

---

## Script 4: check_number.sh
Used if-else conditions to check whether a number is positive,
negative, or zero.

---

## Script 5: file_check.sh
Checked whether a file exists using -f condition.

---

## Script 6: server_check.sh
Combined variables, input, and conditionals to check service status
using systemctl.

---

## What I Learned
1. Shebang defines which interpreter runs the script.
2. Variables and user input make scripts dynamic.
3. If-else logic allows decision-making in automation.

---

## Key Takeaway
Shell scripting is powerful for automating repetitive Linux tasks.
This was my first step toward writing real DevOps automation scripts.
