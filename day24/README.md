# Day 27 – GitHub Profile Makeover

## Initial Impression

Before today:
- Bio was incomplete.
- Repos had minimal descriptions.
- Pinned repos were not structured.

Profile did not clearly show what I’m working on.

---

## Changes Made

- Created a Profile README.
- Added clear introduction and focus (90 Days DevOps).
- Organized repos into:
  - 90days-devops
  - shell-scripts
  - devops-notes
- Added proper README files.
- Cleaned up unused repositories.
- Pinned best projects.

## Improvements

1. Clear professional identity.
2. Organized project structure.
3. Better readability for recruiters.

---

## What I Learned

- GitHub is a portfolio, not just storage.
- Clean structure shows seriousness.
- Branding matters as much as coding.
