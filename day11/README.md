# Day 11 – File Ownership (chown & chgrp)

## Task 1: Ownership Basics
Each Linux file has:
- Owner → primary user
- Group → shared access users

## Task 2: chown
Used chown to change file ownership between users.

## Task 3: chgrp
Used chgrp to assign files to a specific group.

## Task 4: Owner + Group
Used chown owner:group to change both at once.

## Task 5: Recursive Ownership
Used chown -R to update ownership of directories and files.

## Task 6: Practice
Assigned different users and groups to multiple files successfully.

## Learning Outcome
I understand Linux file ownership and can manage users and groups confidently.
