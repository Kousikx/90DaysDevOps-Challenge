Day 30 – Docker Images & Container Lifecycle
Task
Today's goal is to understand how images and containers actually work.

You will:

Learn the relationship between images and containers
Understand image layers and caching
Master the full container lifecycle
Expected Output
A markdown file: day-30-images.md
Screenshots of key commands
Challenge Tasks
Task 1: Docker Images
Pull the nginx, ubuntu, and alpine images from Docker Hub
List all images on your machine — note the sizes
Compare ubuntu vs alpine — why is one much smaller?
Inspect an image — what information can you see?
Remove an image you no longer need
Task 2: Image Layers
Run docker image history nginx — what do you see?
Each line is a layer. Note how some layers show sizes and some show 0B
Write in your notes: What are layers and why does Docker use them?
Task 3: Container Lifecycle
Practice the full lifecycle on one container:

Create a container (without starting it)
Start the container
Pause it and check status
Unpause it
Stop it
Restart it
Kill it
Remove it
Check docker ps -a after each step — observe the state changes.

Task 4: Working with Running Containers
Run an Nginx container in detached mode
View its logs
View real-time logs (follow mode)
Exec into the container and look around the filesystem
Run a single command inside the container without entering it
Inspect the container — find its IP address, port mappings, and mounts
Task 5: Cleanup
Stop all running containers in one command
Remove all stopped containers in one command
Remove unused images
Check how much disk space Docker is using
Hints
Image history: docker image history
Create without starting: docker create
Follow logs: docker logs -f
Inspect: docker inspect
Cleanup: docker system df, docker system prune
