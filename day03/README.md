# Day 03 Learning Summary

Today I practiced important Linux commands used in daily DevOps work.

I learned how to:
- Check running processes and system load
- Manage files and directories confidently
- Inspect disk usage and directory size
- Troubleshoot basic network connectivity

These commands help in real production issues like:
- Finding high CPU usage
- Checking disk space problems
- Verifying network access

Day 03 improved my command-line confidence.
